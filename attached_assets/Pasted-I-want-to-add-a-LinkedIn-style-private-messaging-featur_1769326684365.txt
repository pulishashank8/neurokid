I want to add a LinkedIn-style private messaging feature to my existing app.

We already collect a username when users sign up.
That username must be UNIQUE for every user.
If it is not unique now, please make it unique and enforce it in the database and validation.

Important case:
When users sign up using Google login, we currently do NOT ask for a username.
For Google users, after first login, show a screen that asks them to enter:
- Username (required, unique)
- Display name (required)

They should NOT be allowed to continue into the app until this is completed.
Once saved, they can proceed normally.

MESSAGING FEATURE (LIKE LINKEDIN)
-----------------------------------

This messaging system must work like LinkedIn, NOT Instagram.

1) User Search
- Add a Messages section.
- Users can search other users ONLY by username.
- When a username is found, show:
  - username
  - display name
  - a “Send Connection Request” button

2) Connection Request
- Users cannot send messages directly.
- Before messaging, a connection request must be sent.
- The request can include an optional short message.

Example:
User “test1” searches “test143”
Clicks “Send Connection Request”
Writes a short message
Sends request

3) Receiving Requests
- The receiver sees requests in a “Pending Requests” section.
- Each request shows:
  - sender username
  - optional message
- Receiver can:
  - Accept
  - Decline

4) After Acceptance
- Only after acceptance, create a private 1-to-1 conversation.
- Messaging is enabled for both users.
- Conversation appears in “Active Conversations”.

5) If Declined
- No conversation is created.
- Messaging is not allowed.
- Sender sees the request was declined.

6) Privacy
- Messages are private.
- Only the two connected users can see them.
- No public visibility.

7) UI
- Clean, professional UI similar to LinkedIn.
- Sections:
  - Search Users
  - Pending Requests
  - Active Conversations
- Match the current app’s theme and design.

The community feature should remain exactly the same.
Only add this messaging feature using usernames.
