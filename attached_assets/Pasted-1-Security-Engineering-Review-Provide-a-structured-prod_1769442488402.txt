1️⃣ Security Engineering Review

Provide a structured, production-grade security assessment tailored to this type of platform (community + health-adjacent support app).

Cover:

• OWASP-level web application risks relevant to:
– User-generated content (posts, comments, messages)
– Authentication and session handling
– API endpoints

• Authentication & Authorization
– Role-based access control
– Protection of admin/moderation actions
– Protection of private messaging endpoints

• Secure API Design
– Preventing IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)
– Proper HTTP status codes
– Rate limiting strategies for posts, comments, login, messaging

• Input Validation & Output Encoding
– Preventing XSS from community posts/comments
– Preventing injection-style issues

• Secrets Management
– API keys, database credentials, tokens
– Safe usage patterns in server vs client

• Logging & Monitoring for Security Events
– Suspicious login attempts
– Abuse of messaging or posting
– Admin/moderation activity

• Dependency Security
– Vulnerable packages
– Supply chain risk awareness

• Infrastructure-Level Concerns (light review)
– HTTPS
– Secure headers
– CORS sanity

For each recommendation:
• Explain the real risk
• Suggest a low-risk fix that preserves current behavior
• Mark priority: High / Medium / Low

2️⃣ Data Governance & Data Engineering Improvements

Treat this as a health-adjacent support platform, where trust and data responsibility matter.

Recommend governance practices without requiring a full rebuild:

• Data Classification
– Identify types of data: public, account data, sensitive user-generated content

• Data Access Control
– Who can access what (users, moderators, admins)
– Special attention to private messaging and reports

• Encryption
– Data in transit (HTTPS assumptions)
– Data at rest (conceptual best practices)

• Audit Logging
– Important events to log (moderation actions, account changes, message/report actions)

• Data Retention
– Strategy for old logs, deleted accounts, removed posts

• Backup & Recovery (high-level)
– Minimal viable disaster recovery thinking

• Compliance-Ready Thinking
– User data export/delete capability
– Transparency in data handling

Focus on practical, incremental improvements, not enterprise overkill.

3️⃣ Software Engineering & Architecture Improvements

Make this project look like it was built by an experienced engineering team.

Cover:

• Codebase Structure
– Separation of concerns between UI, API routes, business logic, data access

• Modularization
– Breaking large files into logical service layers

• API Architecture
– Consistent response structure
– Error handling patterns
– Avoiding logic in route handlers

• Observability
– Minimal structured logging strategy
– Error monitoring mindset

• Testing Strategy
– High-value unit tests
– Critical integration tests (auth, posts, messaging)

• CI/CD Concepts
– Safe deployments
– Environment separation
– Versioning discipline

• Documentation
– What should be documented for maintainability

All suggestions must be non-breaking and incremental.

4️⃣ Python Integration Strategy (20–30% of the System)

Recommend where Python makes architectural sense for THIS platform.

Do NOT replace the existing stack. Add Python where it adds value.

Identify ideal areas such as:

• Background Jobs
– Scheduled tasks
– Moderation analysis
– Data cleanup

• Data Processing
– Analytics
– Content analysis
– Reporting

• AI/ML Related Logic
– Model wrappers
– NLP classification
– Content scoring

• Internal APIs / Services
– Lightweight microservices

Suggest frameworks with reasoning:
• FastAPI (high-performance APIs)
• Celery or RQ (background tasks)
• Lightweight worker pattern

Explain:

• How Python services should communicate with the existing backend (HTTP/internal API)
• How to introduce Python gradually without touching existing core routes
• How to deploy Python services alongside the current system
• Performance and scaling considerations

5️⃣ Stability Protection Plan

Because the app already works:

Provide a low-risk migration strategy:

• Introduce changes behind feature flags
• Keep old and new logic running in parallel where needed
• Add monitoring before full rollout
• Define rollback strategy for any new Python service
• Ensure backward compatibility of APIs
